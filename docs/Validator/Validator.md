Elixir's validator network is at the core of the network's technical infrastructure.

Elixir's validator network operates off of a decentralized proof of stake system with 66% consensus required, which is enforced at the relay node.

End users delegate their stake to validators, and the top-staked validators based on stake weight will receive will receive the largest portion of validator emissions, based on a curve, for securing the network.

Currently, the mainnet is running as Phase I, and the testnet is operating as v3.
